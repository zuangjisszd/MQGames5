In real live examples the most of the API's are secured. It checks whether client has proper permissions to read/write data. In GraphQL you will do the same. I don't even imagine to allow anybody add any data to our service anonymously.

### Our goal

1. Login by email and password and return a token for current session.
1. Authorize user by token only.
1. Secure a query to check whether user is signed in.

Let's begin from Authentication.
