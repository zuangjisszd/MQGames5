### Mutations
The process of sending data to server is called *Mutation*. Defining it is pretty similar on how you've defined the query. 

<Instruction>

On the `hackernews/links/schema.py` add the following:

```python(path="hackernews/links/schema.py")
# ...code
#1
class CreateLink(graphene.Mutation):
    id = graphene.Int()
    url = graphene.String()
    description = graphene.String()

    #2
    class Input:
        url = graphene.String()
        description = graphene.String()

    #3
    @staticmethod
    def mutate(root, input, context, info):
        link = Link(
            url=input.get('url'),
            description=input.get('description')
        )
        link.save()

        return CreateLink(
            id=link.id,
            url=link.url,
            description=link.description,
        )


#4
class Mutation(graphene.AbstractType):
    create_link = CreateLink.Field()
```

</Instruction>

Let me explain this snippet, piece by piece:

* `#1`: Defines a mutation class. Right after, you define the *output* of the mutation, the data the server can send back to the client. The output is defined *field* by *field* for learning purposes. On the next mutation you'll define them as just one.
* `#2`: Defines the data you can send to the server, in this case, the links' `url` and `description`.
* `#3`: The mutation method: it creates a link on the database using the data sent by the user, through the `input` parameters. After, the server returns the `CreateLink` class with the data just created. See how this matches the parameters set on `#1`.
* `#4`: Creates a mutation class with a field to be resolved, which points to our mutation defined before.

<Instruction>

On the `hackernews/hackernews/schema.py` add the following:

```python(path="hackernews/hackernews/schema.py")
class Mutation(links.schema.Mutation, graphene.ObjectType):
    pass
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

And change the `schema` variable to:

```python(path="hackernews/hackernews/schema.py")
schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query, mutation=Mutation)
```

</Instruction>

This will make sure our schema knows the mutation created.

### Creating a Link
Time to play! On the GraphiQL interface, enter the following data and see how a link gets created:

After, try to query the data again, you should see the new link.
