---

In this chapter, you learned how to build a GraphQL server using [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/), a backend developer platform that combines GraphQL with [serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) technologies.

Graphcool is powerful tool that easily let's you create a GraphQL backend by simply defining a data model using the official GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](https://www.graph.cool/docs/faq/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-kr84dktnp0/) (SDL). 
The API is compatible with all major GraphQL clients, such as [Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/) and [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/).

Learn more about Graphcool by checking out the [documentation](https://www.graph.cool/docs/), the [Quickstart](https://www.graph.cool/docs/quickstart/) or one of the many [examples](https://github.com/graphcool-examples) for all major programming platforms. You can also get in touch with them directly by joining their [Slack](slack.graph.cool) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/graphcool).
