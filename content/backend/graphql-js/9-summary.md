In this tutorial, you learned how to build a GraphQL server from scratch. The stack you used was based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga) and [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com).

`graphql-yoga` is a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playgrounds](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground) and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.

The Yoga server is consuming a database layer that's provided by Prisma. The connection between Prisma and the Yoga server is implemented via [Prisma bindings](github.com/graphcool/prisma-binding).

You also learned how to leverage additional tools to improve your development workflows, such as [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config) or the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli).
