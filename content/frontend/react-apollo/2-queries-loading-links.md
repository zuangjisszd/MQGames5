### Preparing the React components

The first piece of functionality you'll implement in the app is loading and displaying a list of `Link` elements. You'll walk up our way in the React component hierarchy and start with the component that'll render a single link.

<Instruction>

Create a new file called `Link.js` in the `components` directory and add the following code:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Link.js")
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Link extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>
          {this.props.link.description} ({this.props.link.url})
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }

  _voteForLink = async () => {
    // ... you'll implement this in chapter 6
  }
}

export default Link
```

</Instruction>

This is a simple React component that expects a `link` in its `props` and renders the link's `description` and `url`. Easy as pie! üç∞

Next, you'll implement the component that renders a list of links.

<Instruction>

Again, in the `components` directory, go ahead and create a new file called `LinkList.js`. Then add the following code:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/LinkList.js")
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import Link from './Link'

const LinkList = () => {
  const linksToRender = [
    {
      id: '1',
      description: 'Prisma turns your database into a GraphQL API üòé üòé',
      url: 'https://www.prismagraphql.com',
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      description: 'The best GraphQL client',
      url: 'https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/',
    },
  ]

  return (
    <div>{linksToRender.map(link => <Link key={link.id} link={link} />)}</div>
  )
}

export default LinkList
```

</Instruction>

Here, you're using local mock data for now to make sure the component setup works. You'll soon replace this with some actual data loaded from the server - patience, young Padawan!

<Instruction>

To complete the setup, open `App.js` and replace the current contents with the following:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/App.js")
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import LinkList from './LinkList'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <LinkList />
  }
}

export default App
```

</Instruction>

Run the app to check if everything works so far! The app should now display the two links from the `linksToRender` array:

### Writing the GraphQL query

Next you'll load the actual links that are stored in the database. The first thing you need to do for that is define the GraphQL query you want to send to the API.

Here is what it looks like:

```graphql
{
  feed {
    links {
      id
      createdAt
      description
      url
    }
  }
}
```

You could now simply execute this query in a Playground (against the _application schema_) and retrieve the results from your GraphQL server. But how can you use it inside your JavaScript code?

### Queries with Apollo Client

When using Apollo, you've got two ways of sending queries to the server.

The first one is to directly use the [`query`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/reference/index.html#ApolloClient\.query) method on the `ApolloClient` directly. This is a very direct way of fetching data and will allow you to process the response as a _promise_.

A practical example would look as follows:

```js(nocopy)
client.query({
  query: gql`
    {
      feed {
        links {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  `
}).then(response => console.log(response.data.allLinks))
```

A more declarative way when using React however is to use new Apollo's [`render prop API`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/react-apollo-migration.html) to manage your GraphQL data just using components.

With this approach, all you need to do when it comes to data fetching is pass the GraphQL query as prop and `<Query />` component will fetch the data for you under the hood, then make it available in the component's [render prop function](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

In general, the process for you to add some data fetching logic will be very similar every time:

1. write the query as a JavaScript constant using the `gql` parser function
1. use the `<Query />` component passing the query as prop
1. access the query results in the component's `render prop function`

<Instruction>

Open up `LinkList.js` and add the query to the top of the file, also define `LinkList` component and return `<Query />` component passing GraphQL query as prop:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/LinkList.js")
const FEED_QUERY = gql`
  {
    feed {
      links {
        id
        createdAt
        url
        description
      }
    }
  }
`;

const LinkList = () => (
  <Query query={FEED_QUERY}>
    // ... you'll implement this in a bit
  </Query>
)

export default LinkList
```

</Instruction>

What's going on here?

1. First, you create the JavaScript constant called `FEED_QUERY` that stores the query. The `gql` function is used to parse the plain string that contains the GraphQL code (if you're unfamililar with the backtick-syntax, you can read up on JavaScript's [tagged template literals](http://wesbos.com/tagged-template-literals/)).
1. Now you define the `LinkList` functional component where you're returning the `<Query />` component passing `FEED_QUERY` as prop to fetch desired data.
1. Finally, you export as default the component created.

<Instruction>

For this code to work, you also need to import the corresponding dependencies. Add the following two lines to the top of the file, right below the other import statements:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/LinkList.js")
import { Query } from 'react-apollo'
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
```

</Instruction>

Awesome, that's all your data fetching code, can you believe that?

You can now finally remove the mock data and render actual links that are fetched from the server.

<Instruction>

Still in `LinkList.js`, update `render` as follows:

```js{5-6,8-9,11-12}(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/LinkList.js")
render() {
  return (
    <Query query={FEED_QUERY}>
      {({ loading, error, data }) => {
        // 1
        if (loading) return <div>Fetching</div>

        // 2
        if (error) return <div>Error</div>

        // 3
        const linksToRender = data.feed.links

        return (
          <div>
            {linksToRender.map(link => <Link key={link.id} link={link} />)}
          </div>
        )
      }}
    </Query>
  )
}
```

</Instruction>

Let's walk through what's happening in this code. As expected, Apollo injected several props into the component's render prop function. These props itself provide information about the _state_ of the network request:

1. `loading`: Is `true` as long as the request is still ongoing and the response hasn't been received.
1. `error`: In case the request fails, this field will contain information about what exactly went wrong.
1. `data`: This is the actual data that was received from the server. It has the `links` property which represents a list of `Link` elements.

> In fact, the injected props contains even more functionality. You can read more in the [documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/queries.html#render-prop).

That's it! Go ahead and run `yarn start` again. You should see the exact same screen as before.

> **Note**: If the browser on `http://localhost:4000` only says error and is empty otherwise, you probably forgot to have your server running. Note that for the app to work the server needs to run as well - so you have two running processes in your terminal: One for the server and one for the React app. To start the server, navigate into the `server` directory and run `yarn start`.
