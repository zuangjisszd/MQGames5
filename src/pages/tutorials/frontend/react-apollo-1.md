### Backend

Since this is a frontend track, we don't want to spend too much time setting up the backend. This is why we use [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/), a service that provides a production-ready GraphQL API out-of-the-box.

#### The Data Model

You'll use the [Graphcool CLI](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/cli/overview-kie1quohli/) to generate the server based on the data model that we need for the app. Speaking of the data model, here is what the final version of it looks like written in the [GraphQL Schema Definition Language]() (SDL):

```graphql
type User {
  name: String!
  links: [Link!]! @relation(name: "UsersLinks")
  votes: [Vote!]! @relation(name: "UsersVotes")
}

type Link { 
  url: String!
  postedBy: User! @relation(name: "UsersLinks")
  votes: [Vote!]! @relation(name: "VotesOnLink")
}

type Vote {
  user: User! @relation(name: "UsersVotes")
  link: Link! @relation(name: "VotesOnLink")
}
```

#### Creating the GraphQL Server

For starting out, we're not going to use the full data model that you saw above. That's becasue we want to evolve the schema when it becomes necessary for the features that we implement.

For now, we're just going use the `Link` type to create our backend.

The first thing you need to do is install the Graphcool CLI with npm. Open up a terminal window and type the following:

```sh
npm install -g graphcool
```

Now you can go and create the server. Type the following command into the terminal:

```sh
graphcool init --schema https://graphqlbin.com/hn-starter.graphql --name Hackernews
```

This will execute the `graphcool init` command with two arguments:

- `--schema`: This option accepts a `.graphql`-schema that's either stored locally or at a remote URL. In your case, you're using the starter schema stored at [https://graphqlbin.com/hn-starter.graphql](https://graphqlbin.com/hn-starter.graphql), we'll take a look at it in a bit.
- `--name`: This is the name of the Graphcool project you're creating, here you're simply calling it `Hackernews`.

Note that this command will open up a browser window first and ask you to authenticate on the Graphcool platform.

The schema that's stored at [https://graphqlbin.com/hn-starter.graphql](https://graphqlbin.com/hn-starter.graphql) only defines the `Link` type for now:

```graphql
type Link implements Node {
  description: String!
  url: String!
}

```

Once the project was created, you'll find the [Graphcool Project File](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/cli/project-files-ow2yei7mew/) (`project.graphcool`) in the directory where you executed the command. It should look similar to this:

```graphql
# project: cj400nwfthe5501857zl5zvi1
# version: 1

type File implements Node {
  contentType: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  name: String!
  secret: String! @isUnique
  size: Int!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  url: String! @isUnique
}

type Link implements Node {
  createdAt: DateTime!
  description: String!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  url: String!
}

type User implements Node {
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```

The top of the file contains some metadata about the project, namely the _project ID_ and the _version number of the schema_.

The [`User`](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/schema/system-artifacts-uhieg2shio/#user-type) and [`File`](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/schema/system-artifacts-uhieg2shio/#file-type) types are generated by Graphcool and have some special characteristics. `User` can be used for _authentication_ and `File` for _file management_.

Also notice that each type has three fields called `id`, `createdAt` and `updatedAt`. These are managed by the system and read-only for you.

#### Populate The Database & GraphQL Playgrounds

TBD for import command


### Frontend

#### Creating the App

Next, you are going to create the React project! As mentioned in the beginning, you'll use `create-react-app` for that.

If you haven't already, you need to install `create-react-app` using npm:

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Next, you can use it to bootstrap your React application:

```sh
create-react-app hackernews-react-apollo
```

This will create a new directory called `hackernews-react-apollo` that has all the basic configuration setup. 

Make sure everything works by navigating into the directory and starting the app:

```sh
cd hackernews-react-apollo
yarn start
```

This will open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` where the app is running. If everything went well, you'll see the following:

Next you should move `project.graphcool` into the `hackernews-react-apollo` directory to manage everything in one place.

To improve the project structure, you can now create two directories, both inside the `src` folder. The first is called `components` and will hold all our React components. Call the second one `styles`, that one is for all the CSS files.

Now clean up the existing files accordingly. Move `App.js` into `components` and `App.css` as well as `index.css` into `styles`.

Your project structure should now look as follows:

```sh
.
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
├── src
│   ├── App.test.js
│   ├── components
│   │   └── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── logo.svg
│   ├── registerServiceWorker.js
│   └── styles
│       ├── App.css
│       └── index.css
└── yarn.lock
```


#### Installing Dependencies

There are two dependencies that you're going to install right away. The first one is the [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) library that will ease usage of CSS in the project. 

In the `hackernews-react-apollo` directory, type the following into a terminal:

```sh
yarn add tachyons --dev
```

Next, you need to pull in the functionality of Apollo Client that's all bundled in the `react-apollo` package:

```sh
yarn add react-apollo
```

That's it, you're ready to write some code! 


#### Configuring the `ApolloClient`

Apollo abstracts away all lower-lever networking logic and provides a nice interface to the GraphQL API. In contrast to working with REST APIs, you don't have to deal with constructing your own HTTP requests any more - instead you can simply write queries and mutations and send them using the `ApolloClient`.

The first thing you have to do when using Apollo is configure your `ApolloClient` instance. It needs to know the endpoint of your GraphQL API so it can deal with the network connections.

Open `src/index.js` and replace the contents with the following:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker'
import './index.css'
// 1
import { ApolloProvider, createNetworkInterface, ApolloClient } from 'react-apollo'

// 2
const networkInterface = createNetworkInterface({
  uri: '__SIMPLE_API_ENDPOINT__'
})

// 3
const client = new ApolloClient({
  networkInterface
})

// 4
ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>
  , document.getElementById('root')
)
registerServiceWorker()
```

> Note: The project that was generated by `create-react-app` uses semicolons and double quotes for strings. All the code that you're going to add will use no semicolons and single quotes.

Let's try to understand what's going on in there:

1. You're importing the required dependencies from the `react-apollo` package
2. Here you create the `networkInterface`, you'll replace the placeholder `__SIMPLE_API_ENDPOINT__` with your actual endpoint in a bit.
3. Now you instantiate the `ApolloClient` by passing in the `networkInterface`.
4. Finally you render the root component of your React app. The `App` is wrapped with the higher-order component `ApolloProvider` that gets passed the `client` as a prop.

Next you need to replace the placeholder for the GraphQL endpoint with your actual endpoint. But where do you get your endpoint from?

There are two ways for you to get your endpoint. You can either open the [Graphcool Console](https://console.graph.cool) and click the _Endoints_-button in the bottom-left corner. The second option is to use the CLI.

In the terminal, navigate into the directory where `project.graphcool` is located and use the following command:

```
graphcool endpoints
```

Copy the endpoint for the `Simple API` and paste it into `index.js` to replace the current placeholder `__SIMPLE_API_ENDPOINT__`.

That's it, you're all set to start loading some data into your app!
