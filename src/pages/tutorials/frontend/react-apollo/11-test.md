## Setting up the Scripts

Since this is a frontend track, we don't want to spend too much time setting up the backend. This is why we use [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/), a service that provides a production-ready GraphQL API out-of-the-box.

## With Copy Button

```js
console.log('hi');
class asd extend React.Component {
    render() {
        return <div></div>
    }
}
```


## Without Copy Button

```js(nocopy)
console.log('hi');
class asd extend React.Component {
    render() {
        return <div></div>
    }
}
```

For now, we're just going use the `Link` type to create our backend.

The first thing you need to do is install the Graphcool CLI with npm. Open up a terminal window and type the following:
