title: Start Coding
---

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You made it through the first part of _How To GraphQL_ and learned all you need to know to start coding! 

In the following, you can choose from one of the many hands-on tutorials we created for you. All tutorials will start from scratch and teach you to build a fully-fledged [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com) clone.

Depending on what you want to learn, you can either choose a tutorial from the **frontend** or the **backend** track.

### Learn how to use GraphQL on the Frontend

GraphQL is an amazing technology, especially for frontend developers! However, it's usually not that easy to get started with GraphQL on the frontend since a GraphQL server is required upfront

In all our frontend tutorials, you don't have to worry about the backend and will use a ready-to-go GraphQL server provided by [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/).
