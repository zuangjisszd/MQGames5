title: "History, Context & Adoption"

Facebook started working on GraphQL already in 2012 in the context of their native mobile apps. It was developed out of the need to make data transfer more efficient, especially with respect to low-powered devices and bad network conditions. 

The first time Facebook publicly spoke about GraphQL was at [React.js Conf 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sc8Pyc51uU) and shortly after announced their [plans to open source](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html) it.

Because Facebook always used to speak about GraphQL in the context of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), it took a while for non-React developers to understand that GraphQL was by no means a technology that was limited to usage with React. In fact, GraphQL is a technology that can be used everywhere where a client communicates with an API!

Interestingly, other companies like Netflix or Coursera were working on comparable ideas to make API interactions more efficient. Coursera envisioned a similar technology to let a client specify its data requirements and Netflix even open-sourced their solution called [Falcor](https://github.com/Netflix/falcor). After GraphQL was open-sourced, Coursera completely cancelled their own efforts and hopped on the GraphQL train.

Today, GraphQL is used in production by [lots of different companies](http://graphql.org/users/) such as GitHub, Twitter, Yelp or Shopify - to name only a few. There are entire conferences dedicated to GraphQL such as [GraphQL Summit](https://summit.graphql.com/) (San Francisco) or [GraphQL Europe](https://graphql-europe.org/) and more resources like the [GraphQL Radio](https://graphqlradio.com/) podcast and [GraphQL Weekly](https://graphqlweekly.com/) newsletter.
